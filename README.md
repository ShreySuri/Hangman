# Hangman
Hangman game
Hangman is a fun single player or multi player guessing game. The object of the game is to successfully guess the word before the man is "hung". While the words can be of any topic, this program only uses words quantifying volume, distance, and mass in its library. A player guesses the word letter by letter. Each correct letter is shown on the screen, while incorrect guesses get the man closer to being "hung". Good luck, and have fun!
