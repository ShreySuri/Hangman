# Hangman
Hangman game
Hangman is a fun single player or multi player guessing game. The object of the game is to successfully guess the word before the man is "hung". As of now, the word library only contains animals, but different categories might be to follow. A player guesses the word letter by letter. Each correct letter is shown on the screen, while incorrect guesses get the man closer to being "hung". Good luck, and have fun!

Finished!!
